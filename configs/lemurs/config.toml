# If you want a background image, uncomment and set path

# --- ASCII ART / LOGO ---
# This is where your custom art goes.
# Use TRIPLE QUOTES (""") to handle multi-line strings easily.
# CAUTION: If your art has backslashes '\', you usually don't need to escape them
# inside single-quote blocks in TOML, but be careful with indentation.
